          Whaaat up, there! I’m Lucas Fernandes, gratuated in
          Analyst and Software Developer, or I could just me introduce as a
          little padawan with some interests and knowledge in code from São Paulo, Brazil.
          My currently goal is looking for a cool place that I can lend
          my brain and be more of myself writing code, but also a place that
          I shall share my everyday thoughts with some cool people :).
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, to wake up my brain cells I like to read
          fiction/fantasy and political books. Drawing is one of my passion, but ride
          bikes is my passion as well xD.
          When I'm not doing one of those things maybe you could find me
          pouring down some beers around people I like, or just chilling
          watching something or play some video games.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now I am improving my self with my own pet projects(check my github for spoilers), code challenges and reading technical books.
