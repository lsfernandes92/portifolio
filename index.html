          Hello there! My name is Lucas Fernandes, from São Paulo - Brazil, and
          I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience specializing
          in Ruby on Rails and SaaS products. I also hold a degree in Computer
          Information Systems. I'm actively seeking new opportunities to
          collaborate with like-minded individuals and make a meaningful impact
          with my programmer skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy drawing and cycling quite a bit. I view these
          activities outside of work positively because they put me in contact
          with other people and each one brings a different feeling. And, of
          course, this also reflects positively on my work.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of now, I have been studying JavaScript and delving into some
          backend topics. I have been using
          <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend">roadmap.sh</a> to guide myself
          through this process, and I've been posting my JavaScript code at
          <a href="https://github.com/lsfernandes92/studi3s/tree/master/JavaScript">this link</a>.
        </p>
