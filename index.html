        <p>
          Hello there! I'm Lucas Fernandes, graduated in 
          Computer Information Systems from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 
          I consider myself a padawan with a passion for coding. 
          Currently, I am on the lookout for an exciting opportunity
          where I can unleash my coding skills and connect with like-minded individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy stimulating my brain cells by
          reading fiction/fantasy and political books. 
          Drawing is one of my passions, but riding bikes is also a great passion of mine. 
          When I'm not engaged in any of these activities, you might find me
          enjoying some beers with friends or simply
          relaxing while watching something or playing video games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am enhancing my skills through personal projects
          (you can check my GitHub for sneak peeks), engaging in code challenges, and delving into technical books.
        </p>

              At Recurly, I was part of the acquisition and retention squads.
